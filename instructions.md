# Automate turning mp3 files into midi files

## Instructions

# I want to make a system that let's you turn mp3 files into midi files. 

#I have a ryhym game made that will automaically create it's when files are intput. I have everything working and the last step I need to figure out is how to generate midi files and then upload them to pinata. 

#1.Have a place where people can drag, drop, or upload mp3 files.
#2 Take the mp3 file and split the tracks into separate files. (Possible through Spleeter but I'm open to other suggestions)
#3 Take the separate files and generate midi files. (Drum tracks will prob have the best results)
#4 There should be 4 midi files total representing(up,down,left,right) in the rhythm game. 
#5 Provide download links for the midi files.
